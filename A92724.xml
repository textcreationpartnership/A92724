            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

They have in these last papers discovered much pride and equivocation, which is apparent to every impartiall and unbyassed Reader, (as for their Creatures who Idolize their <hi>Presbytery,</hi> a just censure cannot be expected for them) 1. Pride, in taxing an <hi>English</hi> Parliament in such high and imperious language, and endeavouring to tye them up to a tittle to the <hi>Scottish</hi> formes, both eclesiastick all and civill, (save in the matter of the King) as if they had monopolized an infalibility of judgment to themselves, whereof they tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the poore Sectaries; or as if our Kingdom and theirs, were not distinct governed by distinct Lawes, and inriched with distinct priviledges, though I say not there is such a great distance betwixt us and them, as betwixt us and other Nations more remote, yet I conceive it may be of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous consequence to the <hi>English</hi> Nation, to confound our and their priviledges together; surely though we be united to them in some s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Equivocation, in pleading so high

               </gap>, distinguish the times and we shall see a good agrement &amp; harmony against the Parliaments further actings, and their present proceedings. In my judgement our Brethren shew themselves none of the wisest States men, having spent so much Blood and Treasure in opposition to the Bishops, by urging a speedy disbanding of the <hi>English</hi> Army; for is it not very probable that the Episcopal party being the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test number, will prevaile upon the disbanding of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, seeing they are so bold as to raise commotions in the Countrey now whilst the Army have their Swords in their hands, [witnesse the late rising in <hi>London, Kent, Ipswitch,</hi> and the Isle of <hi>Wygh:</hi>] what may we or our Brethren expect in case of the Army were disbanded but it seemes they will hazard their Presbitery in <hi>Scotland</hi> rather then this in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land shall be without life and power namely Persccution which being seperated from it, it is but an empty forme a cead Carcase, alas poore Army thou art but ill rewarded for all thy good services especially from thy Neighbours in <hi>Scotland;</hi> but the reasons why thou art so contemptible in their eyes, are plain and evident. 1. Because the Army have been more faithfull, and their endeavours crowned with greater successe, which hath bred ill blood in the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian faction. 2. The Members of the Army are true <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> faithfull to the <hi>English</hi> interest, and will not be blinded
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:161401:5"/> with a Scottish mist, God having opened their eyes, whilst others are shut. 3. they are convinced that moderate peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able men who have ingaged with them in this cause, though they differ somewhat from the Presbyterians ought to have civill liberty in their Native Countrey, and this Evangelicall Principle of theirs, is that which renders them odious to all bitter persecuting spirits, that would force their brethren by fire and Sword. The Lord of glory bring the hidden workes of darknesse to light, &amp; cleare up the innocency of his poore disposed people that according to his promise they may have a name and a prayer in the places, where they have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached and put ro shame. And so <hi>I</hi> bid you farwell.</p>
